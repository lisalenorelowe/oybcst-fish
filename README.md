## FAMP analysis

Here's a **DRAFT** Notebook containing R analysis of species samples.

## How it fits in OyBcSt
### Provides management insights
>"The recruitment phenology question is a natural fit with modeled environmental variables because of how strong the relationship appears to be. If we can improve the predictability of recruitment phenology by adding in some additional environmental variables from the historic model runs and use those to predict future recruitment timing that would be highly impactful and very useful to managers.
### Uses data from hydrodynamic and ecological modeling
>"Because of the FAMP sampling structure we would need environmental variables on a daily-monthly scale for the trawling sites. I think an issue we'll run into is how few samples were collected for some species and some years so the environmental data from the model outputs would be very coarse and averaged bay wide across a relatively long timescale (seasons to years). However, if we can get a historically estimated surface and bottom **salinity**, **DO**, **Chl a**, water **temperature** over the same years as the FAMP data were collected (1980 - 2020) I can re-run our generalized additive models which I think will be much improved over what we have currently which use real meteorological observations."
